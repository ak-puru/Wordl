# Wordl

This repository is an engaging and interactive word guessing game developed using the C programming language. Inspired by the popular game Wordle, Wordl challenges players to guess a secret code word within a limited number of attempts. The objective is to use logical reasoning and deduction to uncover the hidden word based on feedback provided after each guess.
