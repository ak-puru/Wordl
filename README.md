# Wordl

This repository is an engaging and interactive word guessing game developed using the C programming language. Inspired by the popular game Wordle, Wordl challenges players to guess a secret code word within a limited number of attempts. The objective is to use logical reasoning and deduction to uncover the hidden word based on feedback provided after each guess.

## Features

Word Guessing Mechanics: Players attempt to guess the target word within six tries.

Colored Feedback: The program utilizes ANSI escape codes to display hints in color:
* Green (ðŸŸ©): Letter is in the correct position.
* Yellow (ðŸŸ¨): Letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
* White (â¬œ): Letter is not in the word.
  
Dynamic Input Handling: The program ensures that only words of the correct length are accepted.

Efficient Scoring Algorithm: The game properly handles repeated letters to prevent incorrect hints.
